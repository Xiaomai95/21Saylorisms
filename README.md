# 21Saylorisms - Vote for your 21 most favourite Bitcoin quotes

## Introduction

21Saylorisms provides users a platform to vote for their 21 most favourite quotes from Michael Saylor. The '21' in the name comes from Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins - this fixed supply is in part why Bitcoin is superior to any other form of money, be it gold or fiat currency, where the supply is not fixed.

The website is simple: provide users with 21 votes and hundreds of quotes from Michael Saylor to vote for. Which quote will reign supreme?

This site will become part of the 'Proof of Quote' umbrella site, which is home to more quote sites related to Bitcoin.
